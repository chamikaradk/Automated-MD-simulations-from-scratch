Use of code is demonstated in the published Chapter 5 of my PhD Dissertation (open access): https://uknowledge.uky.edu/chemistry_etds/173/

## This code automates MD simulation by 
	1.Generating topology of small organic crystals using GAFF forcefield with explicitely calculated CM5 (Hirshfiled charge model 5) charge population 
	2.Run pre-equilibration and production run simulaitons including thermal annealing simulations at desired anneal rate, using MD python wrapper

Modules need to be loaded are provided in the module file

Step1: Copy and paste the *cif file into the CIF directory, change input file name of the 1_cif2gro.py accordingly
Step2: Enter molecule name (stick to 3 letter code)
Step3: Select the size of the supercell in 5_getbox.py 
	Currently, generates a nearly cubic supercell box with defined number of repeat unit cells  (i e. box=4 will give you cubic box with 4 repeat unit size volume of the longest axis of the molecule, while maintaining other dimensions close to that of the longest) 
Step4: Enter in appropriate MD protocol parameters (*mdp options handled through python files)
Step5: Run the MD simulation through bash submission files (Run_automated_workflow.sh). 
	This includes thermal annealing simulations at desired hearing/cooling rates
